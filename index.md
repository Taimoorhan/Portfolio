## Taimoor Khan


### Hi, I’m Taimoor.
I’m a freelance UX designer based in Pakistan. I have a passion for creating user experiences that are seamless and impactful. 
‍
In my past life, I worked in International Affairs providing guidance to the foreign diplomatic community on benefits, immunities, and privileges. 
Understanding the human experience is essential for creating useful and effective products. I enjoy using my skill set to empower people to accomplish their goals. I create digital experiences that make life easier.
‍
In my spare time I enjoy traveling, watching Series, and buying more books than I have time to read (there’s actually a word for this).
